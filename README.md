# Employee Management System

Project Title:

Employee Management System

Project Description:

The Employee Management System is a command line application that allows the user to Enter/manipulate data in a SQL database. The app is designed to interact with 3 SQL tables: Department, Role and Employee.Each employee has a "title" that is a member of the "role" table, and each role is associated with a member of the "departments" table.

Upon launching the app, the user is prompted with a set of options from which they can opt. Options include Add Departments, Add roles and Add Employees. Once the data is entered onto these tables, app will let you view the data as well on those 3 tables.
